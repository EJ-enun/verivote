How does it achieve this you ask?, By verifying the identity of each individual voter about to cast a vote through face recognition. Verivote recognizes your face, using landmarks on your face and returns your information and the races you are eligible to vote in. When you vote your information is stored for collation by the electoral commission. Verivote turns every handheld device with a camera into a ballot collection machine."
